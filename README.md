DATE: 26072021 - 26102021 DIFFICULTY: ★★☆☆☆ SOFTWARE: UNITY, VUFORIA

After the experience from my Internship, I decided to try my hands on a different project using Unity and Vuforia again. This time, with ideas of applying it onto the Microsoft Hololens 2.

Application wise, I wanted to create an application to help students with our practical lessons. This app was built with the intention of digitalizing certain Aircraft Practical Work processes, like checking for wire
continuity, wire crimping, etc. Essentially, the student would be putting on the Hololens, and all the instructions and user interface would be displayed in the headset, so the student would not need to look down on
their worksheets for reference. There are even built-in videos that students can watch if they need the reference/help.

Overall, I became more confident in my C# skills, as well as developing apps with Unity now.
